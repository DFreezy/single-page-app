Hi. I am Duwayne and I created a single page application with React.js

This site is a portfolio site where I display my experience and education in the field of software development.

My challenge was dealing with the terminal, but I managed to crack it eventually. To view my site please follow the below mentioned steps.
Step 1: Open the github in VScode
Step 2: Insert the following in the terminal: npm start
